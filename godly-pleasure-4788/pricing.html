                    weeks, which gives you access to everything Everhour has to
                    offer. After 14 days, you will need to pick a plan and enter
                    your credit card details. We’ll email you a couple of days
                    before your trial expires to remind you.

                    This is kind of a basic usage fee. You can subscribe even if
                    you have fewer than 5 users, however, in this case, the
                    minimum usage fee will apply. So it's either $50/month or
                    $510/year. Empty seats can be occupied at any time. The 6th
                    user and beyond are counted at a standard rate.

                    Yes, you can upgrade/downgrade your plan at any time. You

            tracking tools</span
          >
          — including Asana’s preferred integration (Harvest). And it’s not just
          because it’s more affordable than Harvest. With Harvest you have to
          click the icon in the task to start the time, then you have to set the
          project and task you want to track time for. That’s 3 additional
          clicks every time you want to track your time. With Everhour you just
          click your button to start your time. The product team at Everhour
          really gets UX here — their integration automatically pulls in all
          relevant data to your task including task name, section level,
          project, team, tags, literally everything available via the API!
          Imagine how useful having all that rich data can be if you want to
          report on things! No more settling for Asana’s weak and fluffy
          dashboard reports. With Everhour’s rich data you can export it into a
          data source to analyze or visualize in BI tools like DataStudio or
          Tableau.”

          “Everhour is being used by my department now, but it’s planned to be
          used across the whole company. We were having problems tracking the

          "Initially while working with Jira we had a need to measure the time
          of our teams in projects. Our main idea was to improve the way we
          worked based on actual data. After that, we also realized that we
          should have a tool that can help us plan and track time.
          <span class="highlight-text"
            >We started with the Tempo planner and timesheets. After several
            updates from those two tools, we decided that we were no longer a
            fit</span
          >
          and that we needed a real solution to our issues that was bug-free and
          that could actually help us invoice our customers too.
          <b>Everhour</b> is transparent, clear, and very easy to use. We now
          track our time, plan out team time in projects and also we invoice our
          customers in an easy and simple way. Things could not get better!"
